Main idea:
- it should be a little minigame where players could get custom effects with custom Potions or when they wear a special armor
- The aim of the game is to kill all special zombies which has special effects
 

After searching about 4 hours for protocol lib, I'm not able to implement it correctly. It took so much time that I'm not able to finish the development. Actually I wanted to make unique particles at a players head, but without Protcol Lib it's impossible for me...

Unforunately it only allows you to join a gamelobby with countdown and gives you a doublejump potion till now...
